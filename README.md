### 🌍Welcome to my World🌍
[![GitHub Streak](http://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com?user=MikeBrandon&theme=dark&hide_border=true&short_numbers=true&exclude_days=Sun%2CSat&excludeDaysLabel=EB545400)](https://git.io/streak-stats)

I specialize in building fast, modern, and scalable web applications. My core expertise is in SvelteKit, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, complemented by hands-on experience with Rust, Python, Go, and Solidity.

I’ve worked on a wide range of projects (many under NDA) involving technologies like Three.js, Electron, Firebase, MongoDB, Ethers.js, and Hive, as well as advanced CSS animations and interactive 3D interfaces. More recently, I’ve expanded into GIS tools, Docker, Kubernetes, and decentralized tech in the crypto space.

Lately, I’ve been diving deep into AI agents and tooling, working with platforms like CrewAI, phidata, AI SDK, and Neo4j graph databases, building intelligent systems that interact, reason, and adapt in real time.

I’m passionate about the future of the web—connecting systems, people, and machines through clean architecture, powerful APIs, and real-time technologies. Whether it's front-end interaction, backend orchestration, or AI-driven behavior, I aim to create seamless, performant solutions.
